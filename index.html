    <!-- About -->
    <div class="container content" id="about">
      <p>I'm a native-born Austinite enduring the (painful) winters while I attend school at Northeastern University in Boston, MA to study computer science.</p>
      <p>I began to code late in high school, where I was fortunate enough to find a program with enough hyper-intelligent individuals to bring out my competitive side. By the time I realized that I actually enjoyed coding, I was so invested in proving that I could do it that I couldn't have quit if I even wanted to.
      <p>As I started college, the experiences that I had (and loved) from high school eventually guided me to pursue CS for good. As I continue to study, explore, and gain experience in the field, I aim to combine many of the things I love into what I do every day. From big data to app development, I've found ways to dig deeper into all of the things I love.</p>
      <p>Here, you'll be able to see some of the ways that I have begun to combine those ideas. Where software meets music or running or the environment or food (or perhaps all of those), that's where I hope to find my work and make an impact.</p>

          <p>My first coop at Northeastern, I came to Cisco as a member of their NFVIS team, working on the operating system for enterprise devices like ENCS. During my time on the team, I worked on new client-facing features like Single IP and Secure Overlay.</p>
          <p><b><i>Things I loved:</b> amazing managers, interesting new challenges in every feature, open work atmosphere</i></p>
          <p><b><i>Things I learned:</b> work-life balance matters, test EVERYTHING, simple networking principles, basic knowledge of virtual machines and operating systems</i></p>

          <p>Coming into college, I hoped to get involved in research on campus immediately - and found a path to pursue that through a grant in the Northeastern Honors Program. I worked in the Action Lab as an Honors Undergraduate Early Research Assistant and myself getting involved in a number of different projects. From data classification to designing my first website, I began to appreciate the broader applications of computer science in other fields.</p>

          <p>Applying for a research position for the summer after my sophomore year of college, I was accepted into a program through the National Science Foundation to study big data and machine learning. For 10 weeks, I worked in a machine learning research lab on Northeastern's campus to help refine algorithms that extracted temporally segmented features from videos in order to improve action prediction. At the end of the experience, I presented my research to a group of my peers, professors, and researchers.</p>
