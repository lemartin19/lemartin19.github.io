        Why yes, this is another vegan pitch. Unfortunately, from my lowly status as The Worst Vegan Ever, I'm likely not in a position to educate you on the impact of massive amounts of cheese in your diet or lecture you on sticking to a strict regimen of salads and smoothie bowls. I will, however, show you why even I brag about being "The Worst Vegan Ever".
      </p>
      <p>
        Every individual you know with a restricted diet may have their own reasons for those limitations. Your gluten free neighbor may be following the latest low carb fad or have Celiac's. Maybe your friend went vegetarian for the environment or to take a stand against animal cruelty. That one coworker may be going paleo for their health or maybe because they were peer pressured by their SO. For every one of these people, they have made a change to consciously consider and limit what they put in their body. Regardless of whether you agree with or understand their decision, they have made the conscious decision to own what they eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to be vegetarian in middle school and it just stuck - for most of the past 8 years, I haven't eaten any kind of meat (fish and poultry included). While it began for "health reasons", I have had the decision reinforced for me repeatedly by the environmental impacts and animal causes. When I went to Chile and Peru this past summer, one of the documentaries we were encouraged to watch for class was <a href="https://www.beforetheflood.com/">"Before the Flood"</a>. This spurred my journey to reanalyzing what I eat. If you are interested in learning about some of the things I have since learned, I have compiled a quick list of some of the most impactful sources I've encountered. Some of them take about 5 minutes to read, some are two hour documentaries - pick your poison.
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/eatgreenfs_feb2010.pdf">NRDC</a> on a reducing the impact of our diet on the environment.</li>
          <li>A <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160926-what-would-happen-if-the-world-suddenly-went-vegetarian">quick article</a> about meat in moderation and the potential for a vegetarian world</li>
          <li>A good source to understand <a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/GMOs/Pages/GMOsandInsects.aspx">the good of GMOs</a> and <a href="https://www.nongmoproject.org/gmo-facts/">the bad.</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/">Documentary</a> on environmentally conscious eating.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Whether you are thinking about it or not, the decisions that you make to put something on your table (or straight into your mouth if you're anything like me) have consequences. Perhaps those consequences seem invisible or intangible, but that doesn't make them any less present. For those of you who have never thought about your diets before, take a moment to imagine what you ate today. Where did it come from? Who benefits from its production? Who is hurt by it? What will it do to your body?

        I, being the worst vegan ever just ate some Cheez-It's. These Cheez-It's, while I ate them from a bulk container at my office, came wrapped in a plastic bag which will soon be taken to a dump where it will spend the next 30-50 years decomposing. If we're lucky, the cardboard box that contained it will be recycled and reused, but even the energy required to compress the box into a new sheet of recycled paper materials is massive. The whole box, Cheez-It's and all, was shipped among masses of other products from somewhere across the country to the San Jose Cisco offices where I sit. Now, once we consider what actually went into the Cheez-It's themselves, we have to consider the cow's milk required to make the "cheez". Cows are some of the highest methane producers in the world, and if you were to even consider the horrific means of gathering milk from any cow (a living thing forced into a state of hormone induced milk production living in some of the most inhumane conditions for an organizsm on Earth), it's at least a little guilt inducing. Perhaps the wheat used to make the crackers is a GMO pesticide resistant crop, which has it's own nightmarish effects on the environment. Additionally, by eating this Cheez-It, I'm increasing the demand in Cisco's office for Cheez-It's, maybe even forcing them to order more Cheez-It's and thereby supporting the industry for processed foods and dairy goods. In fact, there are a million different things that I could consider to make me flinch when I think about eating a Cheez-It and I still haven't even gotten to the nutritionally void aspects of this edible orange square.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, I love Cheez-It's. I will still ocassionally indulge in eating a couple, despite the fact that I know they are bad for me, for the environment, and for the animals involved in their production. Do I feel bad when I eat them? Yeah, sometimes - but that's because I'm taking responsiblity for the outcomes of my decisions. I'm not a pure vegan - nor have I made the transition yet to holding myself to that standard. I know that my goals and reasonings for going "vegan" still allow me to eat a handful of trail mix between meetings. However, I am choosing to be a responsible consumer by going for the veggie burger without cheese or sorbet instead of ice cream when I know that it's something I'm happy to sacrfice. In doing so, I have taken control and gained the responsibility for my decisions that I think any "ethical consumer" should have. I'm not perfect, and I don't need to be - I just need to be better.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why am I even bothering to try and be vegan? Or, better question, why am I even bothering to write this horrific ode to low-effort veganism? Because it does matter. Even if sometimes you make the "wrong" choice, even just reminding yourself to occasionally make the "right" one is where you can make a difference. Maybe not everyone is ready to cut out all eggs, dairy, poulty, fish, and meat from their diet, but that doesn't mean that you can't start to truly and honestly think about how what you are choosing to eat <i>has a tangible impact.</i> Choose to eat chicken instead of red meat. Choose to eat fish from sustainable fisheries. Choose to eat locally grown produce. Choose to eat less processed food or choose to produce less trash. This is up to you. This is your choice, and you can take control of what is on your plate. This is not a game of deprivation or self-punishment. You can still enjoy what you eat, perhaps you'll appreciate even more what you are eating after you've thought about all the amazing things that had to come together to bring it to your plate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, let's all be bad vegans. Sure, choose to eat that Cheez-It every now and then. In fact, you can even get the burger and fries if you want it. But, don't choose blindly. Put this decision back in your hands. Research, analyze, and consider the way you eat and know that we can be part of a beginning.
