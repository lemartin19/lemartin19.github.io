<p>To the leaders in the LASA community,</p>

<p>I am a &lt;<em>LASA alum/current student/...</em>&gt;.</p>
<p>I am writing in the wake of current events to demand that LASA makes a public statement on the anti-racist actions it will make to support its Black students and faculty. With the state of protests in Austin and the growing awareness of the rampant racism in our own city, the silence of this program on the Black Lives Matter movement is deafening. I am ashamed of the administration's lack of public recognition of the movement, those affected by it, and the systemic issues that have spurred people to raise their voices in these protests. For a school claiming that it "cultivates responsible leaders, problem solvers, and thinkers", this is a disappointing failure in leadership, problem solving, and thinking.</p>

<p>LASA must take action to actively combat systemic racism, especially in its own community. At the very least, LASA must:</p>
<b>1. Outline its plan to increase diversity and steps to maintain that diversity</b>
<p>AISD's most recently released demographic report says that 6.9% of students are black. LASA is 2% black. While that is only a 5 point difference, LASA's representation is less than 1/3 of what is representative for the district. That is particularly obvious (and painful) while LASA shares a campus with LBJ High School. We are all aware of the disparities between the two schools and the tension it has created since the Science Academy found its new home off Lazy Creek Drive. I am sure that steps have long been taken to improve diversity and to discuss these efforts. Now is the time to make those efforts public and demonstrate the ongoing commitment to serving students from any background. LASA must publish the efforts being made to increase diversity at the school and support students of color once they have arrived and then continue reporting on the success or failure of those plans.</p>

<b>2. Recognize the academic segregation that has tainted LASA's history and educate students on that history</b>
<p>As the campus moves away from LBJ's campus, this is especially important. In giving students the power to create change in the world, it is crucial that they are aware of the destructive systems in which they are complicit (and to which many of them can easily turn a blind eye due to the privilege of their race, socioeconomic status, and/or their family's level of education). As LASA works to dismantle the racist system in which it exists, it must also acknowledge its history, teach its students about that history, and provide resources to learn about that history for themselves.</p>

<b>3. Update the school's curriculum to further recognize the work and history of <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/bipoc/">BIPOC</a> (with emphasis on the "BI")</b>
<p>In history, in English, in environmental science, in biology, in music, in art, in philosophy... in every single subject there is a consistent blindspot - in fact, it is less of a blindspot and more as if we had lost an eye. The voices of Black people, queer people, women, and other minorities must be lifted. The gaps in our history are devastating. How is it that 4 years of social sciences at one of the best liberal arts high schools in the country will never once discuss Black Wall Street? How is it not widely taught that the modern police department has its roots in slave patrols? Was our history system ever going to discuss the extent of the riots that led the Civil Rights movement? This is not about being political, but about filling in a more complete history of our nation. Our classes have been white washed the second we step into elementary school. LASA has the opportunity to correct these wrongs moving forward and a duty to educate it's students on these major historical events.</p>

<b>4. Seek feedback from Black members of the LASA community and create a dialogue with students, alumni, staff, etc. on being anti-racist</b>
<p>Creating an anti-racist community requires dialogue and continuous education for all involved. LASA must create an avenue to accept feedback from current and former students, family members, parents, staff, and more. In particular, from Black members of the community - where they are willing to offer it. This creates an opportunity for the LASA administration to be as progressive a community as they claim, better support current and future Black students, and help the school reach the extremely high quality of education that it advertises. LASA, as a program and a community, must be vocally and actively anti-racist.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to hearing your responses for each of these points and will be following up to hear about their progress. Thank you for reading this.</p>

<p>Best,
&lt;<em>Your name</em>&gt;</p>
