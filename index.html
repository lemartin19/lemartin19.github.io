    <!-- About -->
    <div class="container content" id="about">
      <p>I'm a native-born Austinite enduring the (painful) winters while I attend school at Northeastern University in Boston, MA to study computer science.</p>
      <p>I began to code late in high school, where I was fortunate enough to find a program with enough hyper-intelligent individuals to bring out my competitive side. By the time I realized that I actually enjoyed coding, I was so invested in proving that I could do it that I couldn't have quit if I even wanted to.
      <p>As I started college, the experiences that I had (and loved) from high school eventually guided me to pursue CS for good. As I continue to study, explore, and gain experience in the field, I aim to combine many of the things I love into what I do every day. From big data to app development, I've found ways to dig deeper into all of the things I love.</p>
      <p>Here, you'll be able to see some of the ways that I have begun to combine those ideas. Where software meets music or running or the environment or food (or perhaps all of those), that's where I hope to find my work and make an impact.</p>

          <p>Applying for a research position for the summer after my sophomore year of college, I was accepted into a program through the National Science Foundation to study big data and machine learning. For 10 weeks, I worked in a machine learning research lab on Northeastern's campus to help refine algorithms that extracted temporally segmented features from videos in order to improve action prediction. At the end of the experience, I presented my research to a group of my peers, professors, and researchers.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-3">Music Analysis Website</h3>
        <p>A pet project of mine, the website started on a basic idea to try and understand my music a little better. As both a music and a data nerd, I loved being able to dissect how I listened - and wanted more detail than Spotify was providing.</p>

            <div class="collapse p-3" id="spotify-technologies" data-parent="#spotify-accordion">
              With HTML and CSS on the front end (with some more help from Bootstrap), my new knowledge on this project came from exploring different tools on the backend. Using Flask, I worked to understand HTTP and REST better as I implemented them in this website. This allowed me to plug the Spotify Python API into the backend, bringing me back to more familiar terrirtories of Python data analysis.

              This project brought me again to a central challenge of sustainable structural design. My goal was to create a website that would allow me to easily update or add new features without major difficulties. From the file structure to the layout of the website itself, I wanted to create something that would be user and developer friendly. In particular, updating documentation and more carefully following basic software design principles have become a primary focus for this project.

            <div class="collapse p-3" id="spotify-future" data-parent="#spotify-accordion">
              As I grow the project, one of my goals is to add more customizable display options for the data. I also will consider tradeoffs between storing more data and frequent HTTP requests as I weigh the possibility of caching some user data in a database.

        <h3 class="pt-3">Personal Website</h3>
        <p>After a rough start with the Action Lab website, creating my own personal website has been my goal to facilitate a more accessible and stable entrance into web development. Here, it is my goal to become more familiar with some basic principles of web design and the different technologies available to make it easier. I've begun to pay attention the finer details of front end development while studying design and structure for longer term contributions.</p>
        <div class="accordion" id="personal-accordion">

            <div class="card-header">

            </div>
            <div class="collapse p-3" id="personal-technologies" data-parent="#personal-accordion">
              The website is now built entirely using HTML and CSS, but finally using a framework to simplify my code and streamline simple design concepts. Now implementing Bootstrap, I've begun to explore more of the visual aspects of wesbite design.
            </div>

            <div class="collapse p-3" id="personal-challenges" data-parent="#personal-accordion">
              Frankly, the greatest obstacles have been my patience and weak aesthetic eye. By endlessly searching personal websites, I worked to implement ideas that I liked. I have been challenged to effectively integrate new features while keeping the site intuitive, navigable, and an accurate reflection of myself.

              As I continue to work on new and different projects, my hope is that this website can document my work. Beyond design upgrades, I will also be adding to the content with blogs about other aspects of my life (yes! I do more than code!) to personalize the page and give a better picture of who I am and what I'm learning.

      <div id="action-website">
        <h3 class="pt-3">Action Lab Website</h3>
        <p>My first serious endeavour into web design, this project was guided and designed by the Action Lab at Northeastern University. In order to increase the ease with which data could be collected, a series of "prediction" games would be moved online. The website therefore had requirements to align with these needs: user data needed to be accurately and securely recorded, the data had to be accessible for easy analysis, and the games needed to be usable from any average home computer. As the project continued, there were of course new guidelines that were realized and standards to be met, but these requirements drove my initial designs.</p>
        <div class="accordion" id="action-accordion">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header">
              <h5><a class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#action-technologies">Technologies</a></h5>
            </div>
            <div class="collapse p-3" id="action-technologies" data-parent="#action-accordion">
              To make the website, I used HTML and CSS for the front end, making templates with Jinja2 and programming the games with Javascript. The backend was Python using a Google Web API to host my website and connect to a database. The security on the website was limited to self research on creating cookies and encrypting data using a python hashing library. While there are plenty of existing tools that would have made my job much easier (and the result more sustainable), my knowledge and background was limited and I hoped to keep the project under control by limiting my use of unfamiliar languages or libraries.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header">
              <h5><a class="btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#action-challenges">Challenges</a></h5>
            </div>
            <div class="collapse p-3" id="action-challenges" data-parent="#action-accordion">
              With little techinical guidance, the challenges of this project were mostly in the longevity of its design and the makeshit solutions to permanent problems. My unfamiliarity with Javascript is evident in the poorly patched code and the inexplicable mess of variables. To address similar issues in the future, I will work on focusing on design from the very start of a project - anticipating future needs as well as their growth. In addition, I aim to research available technologies and principles before starting to code. As I continue to work, I've also begun to recognize the need for a mentor and will continue to seek guidance from a number of different technical individuals as I embark on different projects.

            <div class="collapse p-3" id="action-future" data-parent="#action-accordion">
              I parted with this project for good as I began to work full time for Cisco in the summer of 2018. I had worked on the website off and on for about two years and was excited to start from scrath on new projects or my own. I have passed on my work, and the project will continue to be developed with a new grant the Action Lab received for a research proposal using the data collected to be collected with the games.</p>
