      <p>
        To the leaders in the LASA community,
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I am a proud LASA alum. I graduated in 2016 knowing that my high school education was one of the best I could have received - in Austin, in Texas, in the United States, even in the world. I celebrated the advanced classes offered and the passionate teachers that made those possible. I praised the various awards that our students and teachers were receiving - from poetry competitions and national scholarships to Quiz Bowl championships and research grants. I even touted the viral lip sync videos that students create every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not proud of the silence on the topic of racism and police brutality I am witnessing now.
      </p>
      <p>
        For better or worse, the four years of my life I spent at LASA shaped who I am today. LASA continues to influence the lives and minds of the thousands of students with every passing year. If the program succeeds in its goals of nurturing our society's future leaders, then LASA will influence far more than just the students who attend - it will affect every individual who interacts with these students who have spent those four crucial years of high school within its walls. That is a massive responsibility, of which I am sure that you, as educators, are well aware.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am writing in the wake of current events to demand that LASA makes a public statement on the anti-racist actions it will make to support its Black students and faculty. With the state of protests in Austin and the growing awareness of the rampant racism in our own city, the silence of this program on the Black Lives Matter movement is deafening. I am ashamed of the administration's lack of public recognition of the movement, those affected by it, and the systemic issues that have spurred people to raise their voices in these protests. For a school claiming that it "cultivates responsible leaders, problem solvers, and thinkers", this is a disappointing failure in leadership, problem solving, and thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        LASA must take action to actively combat systemic racism, especially in its own community. At the very least, LASA must:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ol>
          <li>
            <b>
              Outline its plan to increase diversity and steps to maintain that diversity
            </b>
            <p>
              AISD's most recently released demographic report says that 6.9% of students are black. LASA is 2% black. While that is only a 5 point difference, LASA's representation is less than 1/3 of what is representative for the district. That is particularly obvious (and painful) while LASA shares a campus with LBJ High School. We are all aware of the disparities between the two schools and the tension it has created since the Science Academy found its new home off Lazy Creek Drive. I am sure that steps have long been taken to improve diversity and to discuss these efforts. Now is the time to make those efforts public and demonstrate the ongoing commitment to serving students from any background. LASA must publish the efforts being made to increase diversity at the school and support students of color once they have arrived and then continue reporting on the success or failure of those plans.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Recognize the academic segregation that has tainted LASA's history and educate students on that history
            </b>
            <p>
              As the campus moves away from LBJ's campus, this is especially important. Attending the school, I was only vaguely aware of the history and origin of magnet schools, and everything I did learn, I learned outside of the walls of the magnet program where I spent 40+ hours/week for 4 years. I was not aware of the relationship between magnet schools and busing to decrease segregation, the system that anchors students of color to low-performing, underfunded schools, or the endless other acts of racism rampant in our own education system. In giving students the power to create change in the world, it is crucial that they are aware of the destructive systems in which they are complicit (and to which many of them can easily turn a blind eye due to the privilege of their race, socioeconomic status, and/or their family's level of education). As LASA works to dismantle the racist system in which it exists, it must also acknowledge its history, teach its students about that history, and provide resources to learn about that history for themselves.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Update the school's curriculum to further recognize the work and history of <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/bipoc/">BIPOC</a> (with emphasis on the "BI")
            </b>
            <p>
              I hope that this is self-evident. This is a demand that students (and many teachers) have made for years but has always been rejected in favor of the work of cis white men in order to match Advanced Placement curricula. In history, in English, in environmental science, in biology, in music, in art, in philosophy... in every single subject there is a consistent blindspot - in fact, it is less of a blindspot and more as if we had lost an eye. I vividly remember the discussion in my junior year English class where we discussed the dearth of diversity in our readings. We were encouraged to use a free reading opportunity to read one (1) book by a person of color in order to supplement our curriculum. This is a tragic exclusion of an incredible wealth of knowledge created by an enormously diverse community of creators. The voices of Black people, queer people, women, and other minorities must be lifted. The gaps in our history are even more devastating. How is it that I took 4 years of social sciences at one of the best liberal arts high schools in the country and never once heard of Black Wall Street? Why am I only now learning that the modern police department has its roots in slave patrols? Was our history system ever going to discuss the extent of the riots that led the Civil Rights movement? This is not about being political, but about filling in a more complete history of our nation. Our classes have been white washed the second we step into elementary school. LASA has the opportunity to correct these wrongs moving forward, and I hope that such a mantle will be voluntarily and enthusiastically taken up by every one of the teachers I admired so much.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Seek feedback from Black members of the LASA community and create a dialogue with students, alumni, staff, etc. on being anti-racist
            </b>
            <p>
              Creating an anti-racist community requires dialogue and continuous education for all involved. LASA must create an avenue to accept feedback from current and former students, family members, parents, staff, and more. This creates an opportunity for the LASA administration to be as progressive a community as they claim, better support current and future students, and help the school reach the extremely high quality of education that it advertises. LASA, as a program and a community, must be vocally and actively anti-racist.

          I am looking forward to hearing your responses for each of these points and will be following up to hear about their progress. Thank you for reading this.
