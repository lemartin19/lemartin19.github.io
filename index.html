    <!-- About -->
    <div class="container-fluid content" id="about">
      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <p>I'm Lynnsey. I'm a native-born Austinite enduring the (painful) winters while I attend school at Northeastern University in Boston, MA to study computer science.</p>
      <p>I began to code late in high school, where I was fortunate enough to find a program with enough hyper-intelligent individuals to bring out my competitive side. By the time I realized that I actually enjoyed coding, I was so invested in proving that I could do it that I couldn't have quit if even I wanted to.
      <p>As I started college, the experiences that I had (and loved) from high school eventually guided me to pursue CS for good. As I continue to study, explore, and gain experience in the field, I aim to combine many of the things I love into what I do every day. From big data to app development, I've found ways to dig deeper into all of the things I love.</p>
      <p>Here, you'll be able to see some of the ways that I have begun to combine those ideas. Where software meets music or running or the environment or food (or perhaps all of those), that's where I hope to find my work and make an impact.</p>
