    <div class="container content" id="about">
      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <p>I'm Lynnsey. I'm a native-born Austinite enduring the (painful) winters while I attend school at Northeastern University in Boston, MA to study computer science.</p>
      <p>If you ever have a free hour and want to see how long I can talk, ask me about anything related to software, traveling, running, the environment, Austin, or music.</p>
      <p>I began to code late in high school, where I was fortunate enough to find a program with enough very intelligent men to bring out my competitive side. By the time I realized that I actually enjoyed coding, I was too invested in proving that I could do it that I couldn't even back out if I wanted to. As I started college, the experiences that I had (and loved) from high school guided me to continue pursuing CS for good - after of course switching back and forth from computer engineering a few times in the first year and a half.</p>
